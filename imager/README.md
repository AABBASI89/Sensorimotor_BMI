### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository contains source code for IMAGER, an application to perform intrinsic imaging on S1 barrel cortex using a BASLER ace USB 3.0 camera and a PI piezoelectric bender. 
* The library to control the camera is called Pylon. A stimulator is used to stimulate the whiskers of the animal. To synchronize the camera and the stimulator, two analog pulses are generated by the analog ports of Blackrock Microsystems NSP. This repository is built with Qt 5.6 with MSVC 12 64-bit. 

* Version: IMAGER 

### How do I get set up? ###

* Download the repository and extract all the files in a folder. 
* Ensure that you have Qt5 and Visual Studio 2013 installed on your computer. 
* Open the repository in Qt and configure the build kit. Only tested with Qt 5.6 and Qt 5.7 / MSVC 12 64 bit compiler. 
* Build the repository from Qt. 
* Put all the .dll files in the build folder containing the .exe file. 
* If it's giving "can't find windows pulgin" error, go to the Qt folder in your system (normally in C drive) -> 5.6 or 5.7 (depending on the Qt version in the build kit) -> msvc2013 -> bin -> move necessary .dll files from here to your build folder. 
* Launch the application by clicking the .exe file / Run the application from Qt.
